                <p class="main">Welcome! This website was mainly made for our "Principles of information system" project, for us (<strong>"CREW 404"</strong>) in order to learn how HTML, CSS and JavaScript work. In our website, we are going to share you <a href="#aboutus">about us</a> and our <a href="#hourofcode">hour of code</a> project in this website! By the way, on the top left you can see our logo, maybe you know from which game it is? Yes! Our logo was inspired from <strong>Portal</strong> and <strong>Portal 2</strong> game, which was developed by <strong>"Valve"</strong>. But why did we associate our logo with "Portal"? The game "Portal" was an inspiring game for us, we all played that game when we were youngsters, and that is why we had an idea to replace our 0 from "404" to a portal itself! The game "Portal" was a logic game, where it required a lot of brainstorming and high IQ. Developing a website from scratch is also kind of a logic, and that is why we decided to have an easter egg from our favorite game. If you want to extra information about designers experience:</p>

                            <p>Hello! My name is Naik Pashayev, and I am a Computer Science student in ADA University. I was inspired since I was a child. I had my first computer when I was 4 years old. Afterwards, I wanted to be a Computer Scientist, because I have a relative who is a Computer Scientist and he is really good at his sphere. As I grew up, I was more and more interested on how a system works and how websites, programs are created.

                                Hi, I am Rufat Hajizada, a Computer Engineering student at ADA university. I had a great interest in electronic and digital devices but my acquaintance with Computer Engineering is not long ago. During preparation for the entrance exam, I was informed about many fields related to computers, and the opportunities and the importance Computer Engineering carries for the future inspired me. Since that time, I started to improve myself in that field and came today.

                            <p>My story began with classical story that the first interaction with computer creates passion. However the that differs from others created main path. That is attracting by being unknown of how it does work. It was somehow enjoyable but interesting part was its inside. To conclude, I came to here with digging for more information about it.

                            <p>I've had a long-standing interest in information technology. When I first received a computer as a youngster, I enjoyed playing computer games. Even back then, I aspired to be a programmer so that I could contribute to the development of video games. I was fascinated by how someone who could only write keywords could make the masterpieces that inspired me a lot. As I grew older, without a doubt, I made my decision to get into a prestigious university and become an IT specialist.

                <p>As Team 45, we visited Baku Middle School 284 and lectured an Hour of Code event to 2nd grade students who are aimed to be inspired by this. Thanks to perfect collaborating of team members and active participation of students enjoyed, we reached our goal. We are sure that even this event will change career path of any student, regardless of their being child.
